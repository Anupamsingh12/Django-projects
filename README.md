# Django-projects
The above is sample and basic projects architecture for most django websites.
this includes multiple pages including login and signup pages with a working database connection.
i already did signup and login authentication.
u don't have to worry about this and 
u can custommize the templates
However the templates uses template inheritance and jinja format, so make changes wisely.
not recomended if u r totally new to django.
u dont have to make django project from skratch just clone the repo and make changes in templates.

clone the repo and run >> "python3 manage.py runserver"
then open your browser and type:127.0.0.1:8000

happy coding..
