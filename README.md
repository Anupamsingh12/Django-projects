# Django-projects
The above is sample and basic projects architecture for most django websites.
this includes multiple pages including login and signup pages with a working database connection.
u can custommize the templates
However the templates uses template inheritance and jinja format, so make changes wisely.
not recomended if u r totally new to django.
u dont have to make django project from skratch just clone the repo and make changes in templates.

happy coding..
